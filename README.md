Simple level with 3 dummies that respawn after they "die", dummies has 100 HP.

Controls: WASD for moving, LSHIFT for sprinting, weapons can be switched either with mouse wheel and/or 1 2 3 from number row.

There is three different weapons: Hammer, sword and dagger. The speed and the damage of the weapons differs. I used inheritance and polymorphism creating them:
every weapon derives from Weapon parent class, only things that I override on individual weapon scripts is for animations (selection and attacking animations).

I modeled + created materials for the weapons myself, dummy (and ground textures) are from Asset Store.
[training_dummy Made By iltaen From Unity Asset Store]
[Terrain textures Made By ALP From Unity Asset Store]

The prototype took me 22 hours to complete over a time span of four days.
